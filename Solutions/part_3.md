👌 🤩 Perfect 🚀 — now we’re entering the **ETL & Data Pipelines section**.
This is where interviews shift from “can you write a query?” ➝ “can you think like a data engineer who moves data at scale?”

Here’s a **detailed breakdown with real-world flavor** 👇

# 🔹 3️⃣ ETL & Data Pipelines (SQL in Data Engineering)

---

### **Q1: How would you load data from a CSV file into a SQL table efficiently?**

**General process:**

1. **Staging the file**:

   * In Postgres: `\copy` or `COPY` command.
   * In Snowflake/BigQuery: stage files in object storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob).
2. **Bulk load** into a staging table first (not the final table).
3. **Transform**: clean, deduplicate, validate.
4. **Insert into target** fact/dimension table.

**Postgres Example**:

```sql
COPY staging_orders(customer_id, order_date, amount)
FROM '/path/to/orders.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

✅ Efficient because it’s a **bulk operation**, not row-by-row `INSERT`.

💡 **Real-world tip**:

* Use **parallel loads** if the DB supports it.
* Always **disable indexes/constraints** during bulk load, then re-enable.

### **Q2: Explain the difference between ETL and ELT in a modern data warehouse.**

| Approach           | ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)                                | ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transform Location | Done in external ETL tool (Informatica, Talend, Python, Spark). | Done inside the data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). |
| Data Movement      | Only clean/processed data enters warehouse.                     | Raw data lands first, transformations run inside warehouse.     |
| Pros               | Less storage, clean before load.                                | Faster, leverages warehouse compute, keeps raw history.         |
| Cons               | Complex pipelines, harder to scale.                             | More storage needed, warehouse must handle heavy transforms.    |
| Modern Trend       | Legacy, used in on-prem.                                        | Cloud-native warehouses → ELT is preferred.                     |

💡 **Example**:

* ETL: Clean CSV with Python, load only cleaned data.
* ELT: Load raw CSV into Snowflake, run SQL transformations there.

### **Q3: How do you handle incremental data loads in SQL?**

Instead of reloading **all data daily**, we only load **new/changed records**.

**Techniques:**

1. **Timestamps**:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders_fact (order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date)
SELECT order_id, customer_id, amount, order_date
FROM staging_orders
WHERE order_date > (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM orders_fact);
```

2. **High-water mark (sequence/ID):**

```sql
WHERE order_id > (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders_fact);
```

3. **Change Data Capture (CDC):**

   * Detect `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` from source logs.
   * Tools: Debezium, Kafka, AWS DMS.

💡 **Best practice**: Always keep a **last\_loaded\_at** metadata checkpoint for each pipeline.

---

### **Q4: How can you use SQL to perform data deduplication before loading into a warehouse?**

**Option 1: `ROW_NUMBER()` in a CTE**

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY updated_at DESC) AS rn
    FROM staging_orders
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Option 2: `DISTINCT ON` (Postgres only)**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (order_id) *
FROM staging_orders
ORDER BY order_id, updated_at DESC;
```

✅ This ensures **only latest record per key** is loaded.

💡 Real-world: Customer data → remove duplicates on `email`, pick latest row.

---

### **Q5: What’s a staging table and why is it important in ETL?**

**Staging Table** = a temporary/raw table where data first lands before cleaning.

**Why important:**

1. Keeps **raw snapshot** of source data (good for debugging).
2. Isolates **dirty data** → you don’t pollute production tables.
3. Enables **batch transformations** before inserting into final schema.
4. Acts as a buffer for **incremental loads** and retries.

**Example ETL Workflow**:

```
CSV → staging_orders → cleaned_orders → orders_fact
```

💡 In practice:

* Staging = “scratch pad” in the warehouse.
* Often truncated & reloaded daily.
* Fact/dimension tables = production-grade, consistent, clean.

✅ **Quick Ref Table**

| Concept           | SQL Example                           | Real-world Use                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Bulk CSV load     | `COPY … FROM CSV`                     | Load millions of rows fast.        |
| ETL vs ELT        | Transform outside vs inside warehouse | Cloud warehouses prefer ELT.       |
| Incremental loads | `WHERE order_date > max(order_date)`  | Daily/weekly refresh jobs.         |
| Deduplication     | `ROW_NUMBER() OVER …`                 | Keep latest order/customer record. |
| Staging tables    | Raw → staging → fact                  | Debugging & cleaning before prod.  |

🔥 Why this matters for **interviews & jobs**:

* These questions test if you think about **scalability & reliability**, not just writing queries.
* Data Engineers are valued for **pipelines that don’t break at 100M+ rows**.
