## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Core SQL Commands**

```sql
-- Select specific columns
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table;

-- Filter rows
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
  AND salary > 50000;

-- Sort results
ORDER BY salary DESC, name ASC;

-- Limit output
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Joins (Multiple Tables)**

```sql
-- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: All from left, match from right
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- Multi-table join
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

üí° **Tip:** Use **table aliases** (`o`, `c`, `p`) to keep queries clean.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Aggregations & Grouping**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Window Functions (Data Engineering Gold ü•á)**

```sql
-- Rank top products by sales per category
SELECT product_id, category,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) AS rank_in_cat
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_id, category;
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **CTEs & Subqueries**

```sql
-- Common Table Expression
WITH high_value_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, total_amount
    FROM orders
    WHERE total_amount > 1000
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS big_orders
FROM high_value_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Subquery example
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning in SQL**

```sql
-- Handle NULLs
SELECT COALESCE(middle_name, 'N/A') AS middle_name_fixed
FROM employees;

-- Remove spaces
UPDATE employees
SET name = TRIM(name);

-- Change formats
SELECT TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS order_month
FROM orders;
```

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Date & Time Functions**

```sql
SELECT order_id,
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
       CURRENT_DATE AS today
FROM orders;
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance Tips**

* ‚úÖ Use `EXPLAIN` to check query plans.
* ‚úÖ Select only needed columns (avoid `SELECT *` in production).
* ‚úÖ Index **join keys** & **filter columns**.
* ‚úÖ Use **CTEs** for step-by-step logic in complex pipelines.

---

## üíº **Real-World Challenges**

**Q1:** Find the **top 3 products by revenue in 2024**.
**Q2:** Identify **customers who made no purchases in the last 6 months**.
**Q3:** Get the **month-over-month growth rate** of orders.

---

## üìù **Practice Task**

**Dataset:** `orders`, `order_details`, `products`, `customers`
**Goal:** Return:

* Customer name
* Total orders in 2024
* Total spend in 2024
  Sort by **total spend DESC**.

üí° **Hint:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name,
       COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
       SUM(od.quantity * p.price) AS total_spend
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;
```
